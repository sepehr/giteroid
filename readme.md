# Giteroids
Small yet handy collection of useful scripts & aliases to deal with git repos on daily basis.


## Scripts
### Installation
For standalone scripts, do a `git clone` somewhere in your `$PATH` & make the scripts executable. That's a `chmod +x`. Simple. 

#### `git tags`
It's important to version the release changelogs within a repository. Some choose to use a separate `CHANGELOG.md`, however, Git tag annotations are also a great tool for this purpose. 

The `git tags` script provides a readable colored trail of annotated git tags which serve as the chronological trail for the release tags & changelogs. If provided with `-n N` argument, it shows the last `n` release tags.

#### `git changelog`
What were the changes since the latest annotated tag? `git changelog` has the answer:

```

- vfs: get rid of old '->iterate' directory operation
- proc: fix missing conversion to 'iterate_shared'
- open: make RESOLVE_CACHED correctly test for O_TMPFILE
```

#### `git release`
Time to release a new version? `git release` might be handy, especially if you also use Gitlab as the `origin` remote of the repo.

Given a tag, for example `4.2.0`, it create a new annotated tag using the `git changelog` output and optionally if provided with `--gitlab` argument, creates a corresponding Gitlab release on the remote. 

For the gitlab release functionality to work, a  `GITLAB_RELEASE_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable must be in context; which is a personal access token with the `api` scope. Export it somewhere in your shell configuration.

```
export GITLAB_RELEASE_ACCESS_TOKEN="my-gitlab-token-with-api-scope-access'

‚óè git release 4.2.0 --gitlab

#### `git fixup [ref-hash]`
Does a transparent rebase by fixing up the all the uncommitted changes into the last commit, or optionally the given ref hash.

```
‚óè git fixup

## Aliases
### Installation
To install git aliases, add a [`include.path`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config#_includes) config directive to your global git config file at `~/.gitconfig`:

```ini
[includes]
  path = /path/to/giteroids-repo/giteroids.gitconfig
```

Check out that file for a list of available aliases.
